# How to add this plugin to your project
1. Go at your project location folder (where the `.uproject` file is)
2. Go in the `Plugins` folder
3. In the windows cmd (or anything else you might use) clone this git and the `BlueprintComponentReferencePlugin` dependency
  - `git clone https://github.com/hzFishy/FishyUtils.git`
  - `git clone https://github.com/aquanox/BlueprintComponentReferencePlugin.git`
